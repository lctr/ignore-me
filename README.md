# A `.gitignore` file generator
This is a simple command line utility that generates a
`.gitignore` file for a project, placing it in the same directory as
where the command was called.

The `.gitignore` files are *entirely* pulled from the
[github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore) repository.
